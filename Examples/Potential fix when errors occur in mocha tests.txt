There are a few potential issues and improvements in your code snippet:

1. Typo: `'content-type': 'aplication/json'` should be `'content-type': 'application/json'`.

2. Error Handling: You should handle errors that might occur during the fetch operation, for example, network errors or server errors.

3. Asynchronous Operations: The `fetchPresentsFromDataBase()` function is likely asynchronous, so you need to make sure it's executed after the POST request is complete. You can achieve this by placing it inside the `.then()` block of the fetch operation.

Here's the modified code considering these points:

```javascript
addPresentButton.addEventListener('click', add => {
    let presentToAdd = presentInputField.value;
    let presentFor = forInputField.value;
    let presentPrice = priceInputField.value;
    
    fetch(baseURL, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'content-type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            gift: presentToAdd,
            for: presentFor,
            price: presentPrice,
        })
    })
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        }
        // Assuming fetchPresentsFromDataBase() returns a Promise
        return fetchPresentsFromDataBase();
    })
    .then(() => {
        presentInputField.value = '';
        forInputField.value = '';
        priceInputField.value = '';
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
        // Handle the error appropriately, e.g., show a message to the user
    });
});
```

This code includes error handling for the fetch operation and ensures that the input fields are cleared only after the POST request is successfully completed.
